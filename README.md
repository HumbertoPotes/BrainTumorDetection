# BrainTumorDetection

## Summary
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for brain tumor detection and segmentation using annotated MRI images. Leveraging a dataset from Hugging Face’s DWb2023 repository, it demonstrates strong performance in both pixel-wise segmentation and tumor classification. The model achieves over 99% classification accuracy and a 0.7 Intersection over Union (IoU) for bounding box localization. Visualizations comparing model predictions against ground truth masks highlight the network’s effectiveness in identifying and segmenting tumor regions.
